KillaKreditz by Sleaker

KillaKreditz is a plugin that rewards players monetarily for killing creatures.

To give your players these rewards you will need to give them the permissions:

This will reward your players for killing any monsters.
'kkreditz.reward.*'

Alternatively you can reward them for only specific creature types:
'kkreditz.reward.skeleton'
'kkreditz.reward.zombie'

You can also give them access to different multipliers (only the highest one will be used)
'kkreditz.multiplier.triple'
'kkreditz.multiplier.double'
'kkreditz.multiplier.alt1'
'kkreditz.multiplier.alt2'
'kkreditz.multiplier.alt3'

the alternative multipliers are set in the main configuration file: plugins/KillaKreditz/config.yml

This plugin uses per-world rewards.  This means that you must define each worlds creature rewards explicitly.
