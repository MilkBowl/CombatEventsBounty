CombatEventsLoot by Sleaker

CombatEventsLoot is a plugin that rewards players with money for killing creatures.

To give your players these rewards you will need to give them the permissions:

This will reward your players for killing any monsters.
'combatevents.loot.*'

Alternatively you can reward them for only specific creature types:
'combatevents.loot.skeleton'
'combatevents.loot.zombie'

You can also give them access to different multipliers by giving an info node such as:
cemultiplier: 2


This plugin uses per-world rewards.  This means that you must define each worlds creature rewards explicitly.
